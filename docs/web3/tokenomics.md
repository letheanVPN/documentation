# 📄 Lethean Whitepaper (Reimagined Chain)

## 🔒 Introduction

Lethean is a decentralized platform focused on delivering private, censorship-resistant access to internet services — with VPNs as its first major use case. Originally launched as a Cryptonote-based privacy coin, Lethean is now entering a new chapter.

We are initiating a **hard fork** of the current Lethean blockchain, adopting rich features of the **Zano codebase**, while retaining Lethean's mission and community. This move brings modern features, greater scalability, and long-term sustainability.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of the Fork

The new Lethean blockchain aims to:

- Modernize its infrastructure using Zano's active Cryptonote development base
- Rebuild trust with old holders and attract new investors
- Reinforce its original use case: decentralized VPN access
- Enable long-term support for developers, VPN providers, and coin holders

---

## 📈 Market Opportunity

The **[global VPN market](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/virtual-private-network-market)** is projected to grow as follows:

- **2024**: $72.89 billion  
- **2025**: $88.96 billion  
- **2034**: $534.22 billion  
- **CAGR**: 22.04% (2024–2034)

Lethean aims to capture a slice of this massive and growing market by offering a decentralized, privacy-first alternative to traditional VPN providers.

## 🧬 Chain Upgrade & Snapshot

| Parameter                 | Value                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Parent Chain              | Lethean (original Cryptonote fork)         |
| New Codebase              | Lethean code base with Zano improvements   |
| Max Supply                | 21 million LTHN                            |
| Initial Supply            | 10 million LTHN                            |
| Snapshot Ratio            | 100 old LTHN = 1 new LTHN                  |
| Swap Window               | 6 months post-launch                       |
| Unclaimed Swap Allocation | Dev fund / ecosystem grants                |

After the 6-month token swap period, any unclaimed coins will be reallocated to the **developer and ecosystem fund**, subject to transparency and multi-sig control.

## 💰 Tokenomics Overview

### 🪙 Coin Distribution

| Category          | Allocation (%) | Notes                                           |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Proof of Work     | 45%            | Miners secure the network and receive rewards   |
| Proof of Stake    | 45%            | Stakers earn passive income for validating      |
| Developer Fund    | 10%            | Funded at genesis; supports ongoing development |

The **developer fund** is established at genesis and may receive unclaimed swap coins. This fund will be used for development bounties, grants, partnerships, and infrastructure.

---

### 📉 Inflation & Supply Management

| Year           | Target Inflation | Notes                                             |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Y1             | 20%              | High initial reward to attract users              |
| Y2+            | Gradual decrease | Floor target ~5% per year                         |
| Max Supply Cap | 21 million LTHN  | Enforced via smart emissions and burning          |

- **Burning Mechanism**: A portion of coins will be permanently destroyed during ecosystem usage — especially VPN service payments — ensuring deflationary pressure.
- **No supply will exceed 21 million coins**.

## 🧾 Rewarding Key Stakeholders

Lethean identifies **four critical actors** that must be incentivized:

### 1. 🧑‍💻 Developers
- Supported via a 10% genesis allocation + unclaimed swap funds
- Transparent multisig-controlled wallet
- Used for: core development, security audits, feature bounties

### 2. 💼 Coin Investors
- Rewarded via **Proof-of-Stake** (PoS)
- Incentivized to hold and secure the network
- Help support long-term price stability and market cap growth

### 3. 🌐 VPN Service Providers
- Must hold a **minimum balance of LTHN per exit node**
- VPN exits may require a base amount (TBD: e.g., 500 LTHN per node)
- Encourages healthy collateral and trust-based provisioning

### 4. 🧑‍💻 VPN Users
- Will use LTHN to pay for anonymous VPN access
- Benefit from low-cost, decentralized infrastructure
- Enable coin-burning on each purchase to support token scarcity

---

## 🏗️ Governance & Ecosystem Growth

- **Open-Source Governance**: Community-driven improvements, proposals, and grants
- **DAO (Future)**: Consider establishing a Lethean DAO post-launch
- **Ecosystem Incentives**: Dev grants, VPN gateway incentives, liquidity mining (optional)

---

## 📅 Roadmap Preview

| Phase            | Milestone                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Phase 0      | Vision, planning, branding                        |
| 🚧 Phase 1       | Fork codebase, define tokenomics, build testnet   |
| ⏳ Phase 2       | Token snapshot, infrastructure setup, wallet UX   |
| 🔜 Phase 3       | Launch 6-month token swap period                  |
| 🔜 Phase 4       | Mainnet go-live, PoW/PoS activation, VPN testing  |
| 🔜 Phase 5       | Burn mechanics, staking UI, exchange listing      |

---

## 🔐 Summary

The new Lethean chain is a fresh start — rooted in its original mission, powered by modern technology, and guided by fair and transparent tokenomics. With a clear path to incentivizing developers, service providers, investors, and users, Lethean is poised to reclaim its place in the decentralized privacy economy.

> Lethean is more than just a coin. It's infrastructure for a freer internet.
