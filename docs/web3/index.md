# Web3 & Blockchain Settings

Welcome to the Web3 section of the Lethean documentation. Here you'll find resources and guides for interacting with the Lethean blockchain, configuring network settings, and understanding the decentralized infrastructure that powers the network.

This section will cover:

- How to connect to and interact with the Lethean blockchain
- Configuration options for wallets, nodes, and RPC endpoints
- Security and privacy considerations for Web3 operations
- Links to tokenomics and other related topics

For details on Lethean's tokenomics, see the child page in the navigation. Additional guides and technical references will be added as the network evolves.


## Upstream Acknowledgment 

Lethean is a network, ontop of the Confidential CryptoNote Ledger; While blockchain plays a huge role for us, it is not what we do. 
We are a community of people who believe in the power of decentralization and the importance of confidentiality.

We have forked the spiritual successor to CryptoNote, and this section is to thank them, the Zano project and share a snippet about them;


???+ quote "From docs.zano.org"

    Zano’s lead developer Andrey Sabelnikov created the first-ever privacy coin protocol code base named CryptoNote. Today, this protocol is used by Monero and hundreds of other projects.

    Zano is the advanced evolution of Cryptonote, emphasizing unparalleled privacy and adopting a wide variety of technologies that can be used to create all kinds of privacy-focused decentralized applications (dApps) and other projects.

    Here are they summed up:

    - Zarcanum: A hallmark of Zano, introducing the world's first hidden amounts Proof of Stake scheme, shaping a novel benchmark in blockchain consensus.
    - Confidential Assets: Beyond the Zano coin, our platform enables user-creatable privacy tokens that possess all the features and functionalities of the native coin, ensuring complete transactional privacy.
    - Ionic Swaps: In Zano's ecosystem, users can smoothly trade between different crypto assets, all while maintaining the essence of privacy.
    - Hybrid PoW/PoS Consensus: By uniting the strengths of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake processes, Zano delivers enhanced security, curbing double-spend vulnerabilities.
    - Auditable Wallets: An opt-in feature that enables people and organizations to create transparent wallets for situations where we would rather verify than trust. Creating auditable wallets doesn’t affect the privacy of the Zano network in any way.
    - Core Performance: Zano's asynchronous core is a testament to computational efficiency, ensuring forward/backward compatibility and a modular approach ready for the crypto realm's challenges.

    Additionally, with features like the dynamic Marketplace API, adaptable Escrow/P2P Contracts,
