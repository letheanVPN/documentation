# Lethean Network Overview

The Lethean network began in 2017 as the first encrypted decentralized VPN (dVPN). Initially launched as a prototype, the project was soon handed over to the open-source community. Since then, Lethean has evolved far beyond its original concept, driven by collaborative design and continuous innovation.

Today, Lethean is architected as a self-regulating network focused on confidentiality and data sovereignty. This means that users retain full control over their data, privacy, and digital identity, while the network itself enforces security and trust through decentralized protocols. The system is designed to adapt and respond to threats and changes without relying on centralized authorities, ensuring robust privacy and resilience.

As we implement the virtual network stack, this documentation will be expanded to detail the technical architecture, governance mechanisms, and the unique features that enable self-regulation and user sovereignty. Stay tuned for updates as the network continues to grow and mature.
